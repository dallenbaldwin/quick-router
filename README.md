## Why use quick-router

building REST APIs can come with a lot of bolierplate

you might end up re-implementing the same helpers over and over again or worse, have lazy copy-pasta sprinkled throughout your codebase

the goal of `quick-router` is to remove as much bolierplate as possible, while still providing avenues for customization

## Supported Server Packages

at this time, `express` is the only supported server package
